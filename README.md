# Cyber Security Incident Management System

## Introduction

This project is a web application for managing cybersecurity incidents. It provides a user-friendly interface for tracking, documenting, and responding to cybersecurity events that impact an organization. The system is built with Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, and uses Jinja templates for dynamic web content.
